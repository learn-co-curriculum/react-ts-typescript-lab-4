# TypeScript Lab 4

## Instructions

Rewrite your `prepend` HTML application to make it use arrays instead of 2 values
and make the function use generics, so that it can handle both strings and
numbers.

In order to allow any value to be entered in your input fields, remove the
`type` attribute from the `input` tag.

Note: this could be done by using a union type instead of using generics, but
the point of the exercise is to practice using arrays and using generics.
